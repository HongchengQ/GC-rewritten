# Commands
When many commands are involved, certain standards must be established.

# Descriptions
Command descriptions are language-driven when enabled.\
To use language-driven descriptions, prepend a `$` to the description.

Otherwise, descriptions are displayed as plain text.

# Messages
Messages are an instance of `Text`, which is one of many things:
- The class can be language-driven.
- The class can be plain-text.
- The class is rich and can be formatted.

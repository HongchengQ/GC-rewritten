# Commands
When many commands are involved, certain standards must be established.

# Descriptions
Command descriptions are language-driven when enabled.\
To use language-driven descriptions, prepend a `$` to the description.

Otherwise, descriptions are displayed as plain text.

# Adding Command Usages
When writing a command's usage statement, use the following conventions:
- Use `[]` to denote an optional argument.
- Use `<>` to denote a required argument.
- Use `|` to denote a choice between arguments.
- Use `...` to denote a variable number of arguments.
